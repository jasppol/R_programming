## R programming notes
This file contains notes concerning R programming. Mainly messing around with command and data.

```##Code

##assign a vector, in this case a sequence of integers
x <- 1:20
print(x)

##casting a number as integer
y <-1L
print(y)

##creating a numeric vector
z <- vector("numeric", length =10)
print(z)




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
